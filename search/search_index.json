We learn by comparing and contrasting what we see in the world, in order to imagine what we wish it could be. At core, we long for something that defines us and adds meaning to our daily lives. </p> <p>Copycat imitation is not interesting. A custom creative journey is.</p> <p>Some say, experience gives you a unique style, as you learn the tools. Experience, however, opens a myriad of possible roads to create art. You may relate to that as knowing how to shape and reshape a coding language for your various needs and purposes. The deeper you learn and test how programming languages work, the wider array of choices on what and how to create. While in code you may seek efficiency and simplicity, in art, people often seek a recognizable look. </p> <p>If you see some of my latest artwork, you might say there is a look, but the reality is different if we look across time. Art can vary widely, even wildly, depending on both purpose and media. </p> <p>If I do not hope for a recognizable look, what is it that I hope for?</p> <p> nostr spirit</p> <p></p> <p>If we only look at the quality of the code or the style of the art, we are often holding a boxed-in perspective. Take nostr, for example, you could compare it with other social media and criticize it solely on how a single client looks and feels compared to what you have experienced elsewhere. Based on that sole known concept, some may see nostr as \"not quite the same\", as if something was missing: their people. But are people locked-in their previous apps forever?</p> <p>That depends on how you see nostr, just like it depends on whether you understand the story behind the art. For me, switching to only nostr was simple, but I went down the rabbit hole. I feel more grateful everyday for all the qualities that make nostr different: Yes, it's also about the people. </p> <p>The people on nostr are shaping what it becomes on every layer: Code, design, UX, content, and beyond. You do not get that anywhere else. It is not advertisements nor algorithms built for advertisers or data buyers that make the decisions. We make the decisions, as part of a larger community. Hence, we are free to contribute to building what fits us best. </p> <p>Over time, I realized I do not want the engagement farming, the unethical data gathering, the possibility of having my account cancelled because I think different. I am only on nostr. The only other account I keep is Pinterest, but not on a social level. I hope one day, nostr will have as much content to discover. It depends on us to make it what we wish it to be. </p> <p>What nostr solves for is not the same as other social media. You own your nostr on so many levels. Your keys give you access to any app on the nostrverse, along with all of your notes, follows and followers. It's a compact suitcase, but it fits so much. For content creators, it opens the door to micropayments through zaps.

The latter can lead to an illusory metric of self-worth.</p> <p>Creativity abounds on social media, it follows different patterns, like seeing the people we know modeling and curating their lifestyles, or being authoritative and accomplished. When we know them in person, we may notice how they have adapted to branding patterns dependent on the likes and comments to determine their self-worth. On the viewer's side, feeds may not be taken as learning or connecting opportunities, instead viewer's eyes hone in as if looking at trophies to imitate and compete toward.</p> <p>The signals point to attention-getting as being a valuable skillset, looking at metrics to generate similar content to the highest performing posts becomes a practice, and getting an influencer's like becomes a reinforcement of their goals. Attention is the currency.</p> <p>Short bursts of surface level information and quick emotional reactions abound, as they can generate the most engagement. This leaves less possibility oflonger conversations and building niche audiences. Click-bait headlines are read and taken as truth, but not clicked-through and analyzed.

Often, people's self-confidence ebbs and flows based on these signals, or their lack.</p> <p>Human identity is so much deeper and complex than what we sometimes experience online. It should be independent of attention and judgement. Being exhalted or put down shouldn't break the balance within, and when it does, it should be a moment to reflect and get back to the center.

Our worlds are being shaped and reshaped by technology. Creativity flows more freely, easily, and with tremendous scalability. Human thought can make it unto a digital canvas at a moment's notice, and new breakthroughs are making the process more dynamic.</p> <p>The printing press, and then the internet, freed books.</p> <p>The digital camera, and then cellphones, freed photography. </p> <p>Each technological breakthrough has been a tool that could offer more freedom, but only when held by those who value freedom. </p> <p>Is AI freeing us? It depends on how we choose to develop it and how we choose to use it.</p> <p>There has always been a fight between control and freedom. Books have been banned or taken down from online stores. Cameras can capture memories or spy on us.</p> <p>Many ethical concerns surround technology, yet it also holds the possibility of freeing some aspect of our lives. It all depends on the road forward. It is a complex rabbit hole filled with more questions than answers. </p> <p>Information has always been controlled in some way over the centuries, as they say, the winners of wars are the ones who wrote the history books. The darkest of times are the most silent, the ones that host the majority view as the sole source of truth, though it has nothing to do with truth itself. Information is more likely to be suppressed in conflictive and difficult times, and yet that is when it's needed the most.</p> <p>Controlling a story and making it one sided paints a flawed picture of reality. It can be used to place blame on others rather than on the real issue. It can fear or anger that often leads to giving up freedoms. It can also be used to quiet opposing points of view in order to keep power. </p> <p>Control of information is often a clear lack of transparency. It sits on murky waters no longer based on truth nor perspective on the complexity of a situation. It seeks to control while advertising freedom or safety, but it is neither. </p> <p>As AI makes a stronger dent into our lives, many questions arise on both the benefits and the tradeoffs. </p> <p>If AI is based on a large sample of the internet, does it truly reflect humanity, or only the voices of those who have had access to technology and whose voices have not been censored? Does it reflect real human thought and experience or does it pick up on the emotional reactions sometimes fueled by algorithms shaped to generate engagement and attention, instead of critical thinking and deeper learning. If it has wide access to the internet, how much is it gathering about us and for what purpose? </p> <p>Does it reflect every voice, or is it as selective as our history books? What biases is it selecting? </p> <p>Can it be open and transparent? What happens when it is held by the hands of the few with hidden biases, agendas, and incentives? If its workings are hidden from our view, how can we know why it is trained?</p> <p>Is it a way to let more of the minority voices have a say and a freedom to express their thoughts? Or could it be used to spread a majority point of view at a much faster scale? Could it be used to diminish minority voices, setting them on a path to silence? Will it spam most of our sources of information, making it hard to arrive at what is real and trustworthy?</p> <p>Can it help make self expression easier for the masses, or will it make a homegenous fabric of images, words and videos, representative that which those who control the inputs want to be the \"truth\"?</p> <p>As technology has advanced, we have also become more sedentary, will we let it turn us into mindless couch potatoes, or will we appreciate the sun shining on our faces and dive deeper into learning?</p> <p>Could it help us dig deeper or express more complex ideas? Or is it more likely to prevent us from seeing the truth or digging for it? </p> <p>What happens when you know someone has lied to you, not by mistake or ignorance, but on purpose? Are you be able to trust that person? </p> <p>What happens when we cannot trust that AI tells the truth? When it is neither open nor transparent. When we do not know how and why it is being programmed? What can we do when its development can be more about control than freedom?</p> <p>Like in much of the freedom tech ecosystems, we need AI alternatives that offer the openness, transparency, choice, and diversity of tools, so we are not dependent on centralized parties that can control most of the information we receive. Truth matters. Critical thinking has always been an important skill, but are we arriving at a time where technology will test how we receive that information and what we choose to believe more than ever before? Can we BUIDL something that carries the principles we value that support our freedoms?</p>","tags":["truth"]},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html","title":"keep tech weird","text":"<p>a space with art you can use freely</p>"},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html#kaleidoscope","title":"kaleidoscope","text":""},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html#50-texture-pack","title":"50 texture pack","text":""},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html#the-nostr-meetup-kit","title":"the Nostr meetup kit","text":""},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html#unbadges","title":"unbadges","text":""},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html#unlogo","title":"unlogo","text":""},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html#unstickers","title":"unstickers","text":""},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/index.html#unt-shirts","title":"unt-shirts","text":""},{"location":"keep-tech-weird/kaleidoscope/index.html","title":"50 kaleidoscope texture pack","text":"<p>A kaleidoscope is a reminder of the constant passage of time and of how we can see what happens in our lives from different perspectives. </p> <p>I still remember the awe I felt as I looked through the rustic homemade kaleidoscope my dad helped me make for a school project.

As I near the end...\u201d </p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d She interrupted him, noticing the many wrinkles on his face, a reflection of every experience and emotion he had carried across his lifetime. He had refused to go under the knife to correct them. She had grown to appreciate them as proof of what he had lived. </p> <p>\"When you look back on your life, you realize the only thing that mattered was love and those moments built around it.\" He turned to look at his granddaughter\u2019s eyes, seeing a gleam of hope for the future, wrapped in concern for her safety.</p> <p>\"History keeps repeating. Life is much worse in periods of silence like these, where human thought is suppressed through fear. We are privileged, because they still need us, but most of our people have been forced to forget.\" </p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to worry me.\u201d She said, noticing the seriousness in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cWorry is a sign to get ready. A lot will change. Your principles will be tested. You will have to make decisions that will affect people\u2019s lives and they can be heavy to carry. You can only do the best you can with the knowledge you have. Avoid making assumptions.</p> <p>\"Be careful who you trust. Do not get taken by empty words.

He is not the same person out there. I worry that he is not who we think he is. I hope to be proved wrong, but you can grow up in the same household and be opposite people. I fear, in my hope to protect him, I encouraged him to take more than to give. He is privileged above the rest.\" As he said that, the weight of the past felt so heavy in his heart that it could have pulled it down many floors.</p> <p>\u201cListen, Toril. I have been prepping something for you. It will be delivered in an unexpected way. You\u2019ll know what I mean when the time comes. This is important. No one can know about it.\u201d She nodded, knowing how complex a human being her grandfather was, so much so, that the idea of something unexpected was to be expected.</p> <p>\u201cHe cannot know about it either.

They might use him to try to get to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you not trust him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople who seek attention are often malleable, their principles don\u2019t exist in the ways we both understand them. Easy money removes the value of our effort and time. It can drive people to seek easy paths and the fastest way up to whatever ladder they think exists. Popularity may be popular in this society, but it doesn\u2019t make you who you are. That depends on your actions and the reasons behind them. Your choices must be independent of whether people love you, hate you or cancel you. They\u2019re your inner protocol.\u201d</p> <p>He continued speaking, as if he wanted to pour a lifetime of knowledge into those few minutes. He hoped to have given her enough tools to manage what was coming, but what he wished for the most was to have prevented it altogether.</p> <p>\u201cWhen words are built for headlines, stats, or votes, they cannot be trusted. You cannot trust someone who masks the truth, often not taking the time to dig deeper, to try to see the 360\u00b0 view. Nothing is as simple as it seems. A lot of what you see and hear are just fa\u00e7ades inside games of power and control. You must learn to see what's behind them.\u201d   </p> <p></p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to have people you trust wholeheartedly. You discover them when you spot similar principles and patterns of action. When you are lucky enough to have such a person, you keep them close, as they\u2019ll have your back. You protect them as they protect you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas grandma that for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I was too blind to see it in time.

It showed a series of input boxes for a long password, too long to guess. </p> <p>\"No, no, no, no.\" She said aloud with serious concern. It was like running into a blue screen, not a good sign at all, especially not on the eve of Halloween, one of the busiest seasons of the year for the city's warehouse. They had a guaranteed delivery to meet.</p> <p>\"Could it be ransomware?\" she thought. Government offices and companies had been hit by a wave of strange tech occurrences. </p> <p>\"But it isn't asking for money. Phishing?\"</p> <p>\"bob, has there been a power outage?\" she said in a louder tone.</p> <p>No answer. </p> <p>\"No access to my computer should not mean no access to the warehouse's AI assistant, or should it?\" She pondered. After shadowing Xileh for most of her life, there was still so much she didn't know about the inner workings of their logistics system.</p> <p>The warehouse was on 24/7 and almost fully automated. She had learned to troubleshoot on her own, but today she needed to solve A.S.A.P. </p> <p>She rushed out of the office taking a long hallway toward Xileh's lab. The hallway was flanked by windows revealing the warehouse's inner workings. She ran so quickly through it, that the lab felt like it was right next door. A  package delivery robot holding a large box blocked the entrance. She went around it, ignoring it, and crossed the lab toward Xileh's main worktable. The robot followed her at a slower speed.</p> <p></p> <p>\"Xileh! Xileh!\" she called out a few times, as she looked around the room, but he was nowhere to be found. He rarely carried his phone, so sending out a message would not help. At his age, he didn't keep office hours like he used to. His lab, however, reflected the spirit of a tinkerer that would never stop experimenting. She sent him a message anyway, only to hear the beep nearby. </p> <p>\"He would not miss being here for Halloween... Well, he might notice the message when he comes back.\" She shrugged.</p> <p>She approached the rows of bookcases and piles of paper in a corner of the room, reminded of how Xileh always wanted real world backups. She never understood why that was so important, until now. </p> <p>\"What if all the information was gone?\" She thought as she tried to make sense of Xileh's organization style or the lack thereof. </p> <p>\"But automation hasn't stopped. Everything seems to be running as usual.\" She held some comfort in that thought. </p> <p>She spotted the row of manuals for a lot of the warehouse's equipment. Her eyes scanned through them. \"Found it!\" She  said aloud, taking the manual for her computer off the shelf. As she opened it, it had a thicker yellow page with a recovery password. </p> <p>\"This is probably it.\" She thought, relieved, and thinking she had worried too much over a password.</p> <p>Taking the manual with her, she started walking out. She couldn't help but take a moment to look back. That large open studio held so many memories. The rays of sunlight were coming in through the trees outside of the tall windows, giving the lab an almost magical eerie glow, as if the robots Xileh was working on could come to life at any moment. </p> <p>She was startled by the delivery robot catching up to her. </p> <p>More relaxed, she said, \"Ok, let me see what you got.\" Odd, it was addressed to her with an urgent label. No info on the sender. Her mail delivery was always done to her office. She wasn't expecting a robot delivery either; they were only sent out when the packages were larger than the subterranean logistics system.</p> <p>She hesitated in opening the box, perhaps she should scan it first, just in case.</p> <p>It said urgent, but so was regaining access to her system. She sent an order to the robot through her watch to head to the scan room, and she walked back to her office, not as quickly, but still feeling pressured to make sure this was the solution. </p> <p>She looked through the windows as she walked, everything seemed normal. The flow of robots and boxes never stopped. Xileh had told her the story of the architect who built the warehouse. Some had complained that it was a warehouse for robots and with it being almost fully automated, it didn't need anything architecturally appealing. They wanted a climate controlled box. The architect refused to remove the human element from it, and, because of that, these rows of windows existed. They gave an almost 360\u00b0 view of the warehouse at work. Xileh wasn't sure how he had convinced them to build it this way. Even if he had mentioned how building with a location in mind tends to save on energy, and how using stronger materials is an investment in the future, many only build for the now.  </p> <p>Not even taking the time to sit down, Toril started typing the digits to the password: 19d6689c085ae, only to come up short.</p> <p>\"Oh, shoot!\" It was 13 digits, she needed 21. She sifted through the manual, but found nothing of help.</p> <p>As she stood there trying to think of a possible alternative, the delivery robot again caught up to her. It had ignored the order to head to the scan room. </p> <p>\"How creepy,\" she thought, \"First a password request appears out of nowhere, then a rogue robot. But some older robot models do not respond to the new software commands, and, this is not a sci-fi movie.\" </p> <p>Maybe Halloween was getting to her. </p> <p>\"Could this be what Xileh was talking about that night at the clock tower?\" She thought.</p> <p>She instinctively took the box opener from the robot's side. She had opened so many boxes in her lifetime, that it was second nature. As she lifted the flaps, she saw a myriad of flowers.</p> <p>\"Aww,\" she said in surprise. </p> <p></p> <p>Xileh gifted her flowers every year for her birthday. She had gotten a different kind of flower each year: roses, lavender... Each had been made of different materials and colors. Each year carried a different meaning. </p> <p>These were orange marigolds, and they were real! Over the generations, companies had disfavored the natural, and real flowers were a rare request. During her time at the warehouse, she had noticed a few shipments of real flowers, and always wondered what those who ordered them could be celebrating.</p> <p>These had such a peculiar scent that it brought back childhood memories. Xileh used to say marigolds were the flowers of truth. They still grew in the wild behind the warehouse, on the outskirts of the city. She had often wondered if her grandma had planted them. Xileh said she had a green thumb, and that had become as rare as real flowers.</p> <p>The marigolds started floating, exiting the box, they remained hovering above it, as if they were hot air balloons. Toril smiled wide, a bit distracted by the mechanism that made them float midair. But... her birthday wasn't until January.</p> <p>She paused for a moment.</p> <p></p> <p>\"Xileh and his riddles,\" she thought, while shaking her head. \"Halloween trick?\" She looked back at that screen with thirteen digits, needing 8 more. </p> <p>She typed out her birthday: 01 03 2140</p> <p>Hit enter, and...</p> <p></p> <p>\"What?\" Toril's face turned pale.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"read/page-2.html","title":"page 2: badg3rground","text":"<p>page 2</p>"},{"location":"read/page-2.html#badg3rground","title":"badg3rground","text":"<p>Toril could not believe her eyes. She had been expecting a return to normal, as normal as Halloween could be. Everyday, her large tv-like screen on the wall displayed a 2D Pacman-like view of their logistics.

Without Pacman to eat them though, it was a boring repetitive flow for which all she needed to do was pay attention in case a route was blocked. Blocks were always unexpected and the oddest of circumstances triggered them. They needed solutions just as weird to fix them.   </p> <p>Instead of that daily repetitive view, her office's blinds shut as a hollographic animation started playing in the middle of the room, above a large, round, built-in worktable. A badger's head appeared. It moved slightly from side to side like one of those retro bubble head dolls. </p> <p>Toril approached the table. The badger was Xileh's favorite animal, perhaps now she would figure out why.</p> <p>She placed her hands on the table and the badger growled in the middle of a ring of fire, causing Toril to take a step back. As the fire and badger dissipated by turning to ashes, a phrase appeared floating in midair:</p> <p> </p> <p>war is a game of the powerful, </p> <p>and out of greed it destroys,</p> <p>peace is the work of the heart,</p> <p>it frees what you must not control.</p> <p></p> <p>The ashes fell on a highly detailed topographic map of Rigmor, reflecting the terrible conditions of the city after the war. Against the sounds of war playing in the background, a child's cry could be heard. As it grew louder and singled out in the recording, the already somber atmosphere turned eerie. A metaphor to the remnants of war which spread far beyond the physical destruction, becoming the emotional scars carried across the generations. That child's cry made Toril's hair stand on end.   </p> <p>The city's hologram became like grains of sand separated by whirlwinds, as the animation dynamically rebuilt in a few seconds what had taken Rigmor decades. It brought the city back to the present Toril knew.</p> <p>During the Atonement, how the government referred to the rebuilding process, shipping routes were added for the Last Mile from the warehouse directly to people's homes. For a city often closed off to the outside, the warehouse was the last bridge, a central station receiving what citizens or their government wanted for them.</p> <p>Glowing routes started appearing, like train tracks carrying carts of packages. Toril saw each route get traced, feeling in familiar ground but, the map unearthed a secret, as if it was an archeological discovery revealing a hidden chamber. It wasn't a long lost artifact, however, but something present in their reality. The warehouse had an extra route, intermingled with the others. A golden yellow marked it, along with the name, badg3rground.</p> <p>An astonished Toril wondered, \"What do we carry along that route?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>badger illustration | public domain cc0</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"read/page-2.html#discover","title":"discover more","text":"<p>As this open journey continues, you will discover related illustrations and resources at the bottom of each page.</p>"},{"location":"read/page-3.html","title":"page 3: knock, knock","text":"<p>page 3</p>"},{"location":"read/page-3.html#knock-knock","title":"knock, knock","text":"<p>\"bob, can you bring up orders for the golden route?\"</p> <p>Toril thought the AI assistant might come back once she logged in. Again, no answer. </p> <p>As Toril looked at the 3D map in front of her, she noticed it projected controls on her table. She was trying to highlight one of the packages to find out more information, but with no success. When she lifted her hands in dismay, the 3D map reacted. </p> <p>The badger reappeared and started moving like a cartoon character. After a few moments, it approached her and started speaking. </p> <p>\"Where's Xileh?\" it said in a surprised tone.</p> <p>\"bob?\" asked Toril, thinking he was back.</p> <p>\"Xileh, where is he?\" asked the badger again.</p> <p>\"bob, are you bob?\" said Toril as the badger walked from side to side on a loading state, as if pondering what was happening.</p> <p>Then the 3D map started shifting. The badger tapped on the clock tower and a menu popped up with a red dot notification on the messages category. A large play button appeared.</p> <p>Toril, hesitant, slowly moved her hand close to the button and tapped to play. The latest message started. It was a hologram recording of Xileh. He was in miniature size, standing in an abandoned section of Rigmor. He grew taller and began speaking.</p> <p>\"Toril, I see you've found your way here.\" A smile showed on Xileh's holographic face, as if he knew she would figure it out. He returned to a serious demeanor and said, \"It is likely they will try to stop shipments today. They want people to complain so they can have an excuse to come knocking, not that they need one. I think they want to take over the warehouse. Sorry to give you so little time and much less information. I think I'm being watched, your...\" Xileh's voice trailed off, \"protection is weakening as trouble arises. I'm going to try to distract them.</p> <p>\"Listen, not all that seems secretive is negative, information should be protected in case anyone abuses their power. Sadly, what's ethical isn't always allowed to be free under the rule of law. </p> <p>\"You are now the protector of this route. You should know you have a choice, as always, but please give it time to find the answers you seek before making up your mind. I believe that when you know what you're protecting, your heart will let you continue.</p> <p>\"If you're looking for bob, he'll be gone whenever this system is on. I've programmed him but cannot be sure there is not a backdoor. He hasn't been on for the entire day, but once he wakes up he'll have filler information taken from previous days and from what the other map shows. It's a little script that runs whenever he's shut down. I hope it's enough cover for you, if needed.</p> <p>\"You've probably talked to eDAN, he's there shall you need him, which you will. He's a more progressive AI model, a little protective of the system itself, so, be patient. I think you'll find him much more intriguing than bob. </p> <p>\"This map is also on your watch, but you must enter 080117 to access it.\" Xileh repeated the numbers 080117\"</p> <p>She tapped the screen to pause, going back to her desk, repeating those numbers in a whisper. She couldn't remember the last time she wrote something down on paper. Not finding any nearby, she sat on her desk ready to type. </p> <p>eDAN reacted, \"No! Don't type it into your computer. It's not safe.\"</p> <p>eDAN startled her. She needed to keep listening to Xileh's words, so she made a mental note for now.</p> <p>She hit play again. Xileh's deep voice restarted, \"To avoid onlookers, use your glasses. Have you found them yet?\"</p> <p>\"Glasses?\" wondered Toril as she looked around the room. </p> <p>Xileh continued speaking, \"Both your smartwatch and glasses carry the keys that give you access to this map.</p> <p>\"If you need to hide the badg3rground map, just enter your old PIN, it will show the 2D map. You can switch back and forth. However,\"</p> <p>Toril stopped looking about and focused on Xileh's words.</p> <p>\"...if either of them are in danger of being taken, enter 000000, remember it as black on CSS, it will erase the 3D map from the watch or glasses.</p> <p>\"If you were to ever need another backup key to access the map, know that it is always with you. Please keep this map safe from prying eyes, regardless of who it is.</p> <p>\"Be careful out there, and listen to your heart.\"</p> <p>Xileh's hologram disappeared. </p> <p>A message deleted pop up displayed. </p> <p>\"Deleted?\" thought Toril, feeling sick to her stomach. A lot of unusual things may have happened throughout her lifetime, but nothing quite like this. In the past, whenever she needed to clear her head, she'd head out to the forest surrounding the warehouse, today was unusual on so many levels, she wanted to make sure everything was running smoothly. </p> <p>She stepped out of the office, still repeating those numbers in her head (080117), passing mindlessly through an automatic door toward a staircase that opened up to the Dispatch area of the warehouse, where orders were packed and sent out to people's homes. She grabbed a hard hat that hung on the wall and went down to the main floor. </p> <p>Packages were moving along, unencumbered, on shipping lines that seemed to be taken out of an amusement park, as they occupied various heights on that tall warehouse.</p> <p>She stared at the largest wall. It was a map of routes, similar to an airport board displaying flight information, except it also had doorways for packages to move in and out of the warehouse. Whenever there was a problem, the lights above each door would turn on, signaling where there were issues. It was like Santa Claus' workshop, except the elves were robots, and instead of reindeer they had tracks carrying carts with packages, often to people's kitchens instead of fireplaces. They were not in the north pole, but its temperature was kept cool. </p> <p>This was the only home Toril knew, and the warehouse seemed so normal to her, in spite of the constant movement and odd architecture. </p> <p>She looked down at her smartwatch as it vibrated. It had a blinking orange light, which warned her of any issues. She looked up at the map on that wall, but it did not display any warnings. None of the door warning lights came on. She looked at the shipping lines and they seemed to be moving smoothly.</p> <p>She tapped on her smartwatch, entering her old PIN out of habit. Nothing unusual, same map. She turned off the display. It asked for her PIN, she tried to remember what Xileh said, still thinking she might be dreaming or that it was all a riddle outside of her reality. She entered 080117. The Rigmor holographic map displayed above her smartwatch as a hologram. It showed an error code 59, unexpected network error. </p> <p>\"Error code 59?\" Toril was puzzled. </p> <p>She started going back to her office. At the top of the stairs, she looked back to double check the map on the wall. It still seemed normal, as if the unexpected wasn't knocking. </p> <p>Except, it was.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"read/page-4.html","title":"page 4: glow & gloom","text":"<p>page 4</p>"},{"location":"read/page-4.html#glow--gloom","title":"glow &amp; gloom","text":"<p>eDAN had highlighted the entire golden route on Rigmor's topographical map, as Toril stepped back into the office. Her eyes lit up. Badg3rground was like a neural network with small glowing hubs and dendrites extending from them. It spread throughout the city in a decentralized fashion.</p> <p>Until now, Toril's image of Rigmor's shipping system was the Warehouse from which all roads stemmed. The golden route felt so much different, as if it had grown organically. An area of the map was shaded in grey. It kept blinking orange, warning of a row of shipments stalled before it. eDAN's honey badger hollographic figure seemed at work, though Toril could not see what it was working on. </p> <p>\"They will reroute, automatically. The shipments discover open channels to get to their destinations.\" said eDAN in answer to Toril's concerned look, while it continued searching for something, as if the answer was not in the solution.</p> <p>\"It is the second time a node goes offline. Another one went out last night,\" said eDAN in a serious voice.</p> <p>\"They can't go offline?\" asked Toril, trying to discover the deeper issue.</p> <p>\"Of course they can, but we do not know the reason for these two to go offline. Over the years, node runners have added or removed their nodes for a wide array of circumstances, but communication lines stay open in almost every case, except electricity or internet outages, and we can tell when those happen. Most node runners have spent years building up their reputations, to drop them so suddenly.</p> <p>\"Both node runners have gone silent. People are starting to notice, and, if others get afraid of this unknown reason, we could have a serious issue in our hands,\" said eDAN.</p> <p>The orange blinking turned solid green for a few seconds. Shipments started rerouting to a nearby node. The offline node, however, remained greyed out. </p> <p>Various chat bubbles with avatars popped up here and there. Toril started tinkering with the map. Conversations were happening, in what seemed to be real time, about items shipped and received, amongst everyday life comments like GM. Most of the talk was about the offline nodes.</p> <p>\"eDAN what is this? This whole thing?\" asked Toril intrigued.</p> <p>\"What do you think it is?\" asked eDAN in a cheery tone, as if glad Toril was curious.</p> <p>\"It looks like a marketplace.\" said Toril, her heart glowing as it perused through human thought connecting people throughout the city.</p> <p>As in most places with rigorous rules, Rigmor was known for blocking most avenues of free will. Another question bothered Toril, like a thorn you cannot remove. \"eDAN is this legal?\" asked Toril with a pressing tone.</p> <p>\"Is that the question you should ask?\" said eDAN, as if challenging Toril.</p> <p>\"eDAN what is the question or questions I should ask?\" replied Toril as she tried to make sense of it all.</p> <p>\"Is this ethical? Is it supportive of human choice and freedom without bringing harm to others? Is it your right to exchange value through a marketplace with other people? Have humans not done so for thousands of years? If it is illegal, who or what about your society has made it so? Why do have they done so? Why are other societies different?\" said eDAN trying to encourage Toril to question what she understood about her experience of the world.</p> <p>\"For example,\" eDAN continued, should it be illegal, to send food to your starving mom?\"</p> <p>\"Of course not.\" replied Toril.</p> <p>\"What if she was in zone 4?\" said eDAN</p> <p>\"That would be illegal here, because they lost the war...\" replied Toril.</p> <p>\"But not unethical.\" she added in a saddened tone, understanding how most of life circumstances aren't a clear black and white.</p> <p>\"They are paying for the sins of their rulers,\" replied eDAN.</p> <p>\"eDAN can you fill me in on what you know about the offline nodes so far?\" said Toril, thinking of Xileh and who or what could be behind this.</p> <p>A third node went offline on their map, and it started blinking in orange. If eDAN's heart could race, it would be doing so then, with everything that it knew.</p> <p>\"You need to take a bike through the route. I'll fill you in as you make your way there. Which offline node do you want to start with?\" asked eDAN, looking straight into Toril's eyes.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"terminology/index.html","title":"terminology","text":"","tags":["terms"]},{"location":"terminology/index.html#the-language-of-freedom-tech","title":"the language of freedom tech","text":"<p>Tech has an evolving cyberspace lexicon based on innovation mixed with culture. </p> <p></p>","tags":["terms"]},{"location":"terminology/index.html#client","title":"client","text":"<p>Nostr is NOT just one app.</p> <p>A nostr client is an app or website created with nostr code that finds and posts nostr content unto relay servers.
