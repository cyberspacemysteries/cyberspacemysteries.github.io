We learn by comparing and contrasting what we see in the world, in order to imagine what we wish it could be. At core, we long for something that defines us and adds meaning to our daily lives. </p> <p>Copycat imitation is not interesting. A custom creative journey is.</p> <p>Some say, experience gives you a unique style, as you learn the tools. Experience, however, opens a myriad of possible roads to create art. You may relate to that as knowing how to shape and reshape a coding language for your various needs and purposes. The deeper you learn and test how programming languages work, the wider array of choices on what and how to create. While in code you may seek efficiency and simplicity, in art, people often seek a recognizable look. </p> <p>If you see some of my latest artwork, you might say there is a look, but the reality is different if we look across time. Art can vary widely, even wildly, depending on both purpose and media. </p> <p>If I do not hope for a recognizable look, what is it that I hope for?</p> <p> nostr spirit</p> <p></p> <p>If we only look at the quality of the code or the style of the art, we are often holding a boxed-in perspective. Take nostr, for example, you could compare it with other social media and criticize it solely on how a single client looks and feels compared to what you have experienced elsewhere. Based on that sole known concept, some may see nostr as \"not quite the same\", as if something was missing: their people. But are people locked-in their previous apps forever?</p> <p>That depends on how you see nostr, just like it depends on whether you understand the story behind the art. For me, switching to only nostr was simple, but I went down the rabbit hole. I feel more grateful everyday for all the qualities that make nostr different: Yes, it's also about the people. </p> <p>The people on nostr are shaping what it becomes on every layer: Code, design, UX, content, and beyond. You do not get that anywhere else. It is not advertisements nor algorithms built for advertisers or data buyers that make the decisions. We make the decisions, as part of a larger community. Hence, we are free to contribute to building what fits us best. </p> <p>Over time, I realized I do not want the engagement farming, the unethical data gathering, the possibility of having my account cancelled because I think different. I am only on nostr. The only other account I keep is Pinterest, but not on a social level. I hope one day, nostr will have as much content to discover. It depends on us to make it what we wish it to be. </p> <p>What nostr solves for is not the same as other social media. You own your nostr on so many levels. Your keys give you access to any app on the nostrverse, along with all of your notes, follows and followers. It's a compact suitcase, but it fits so much. For content creators, it opens the door to micropayments through zaps.

When we know them in person, we may notice how they have adapted to branding patterns dependent on the likes and comments to determine their self-worth. On the viewer's side, feeds may not be taken as learning or connecting opportunities, instead viewer's eyes hone in as if looking at trophies to imitate and compete toward.</p> <p>The signals point to attention-getting as being a valuable skillset, looking at metrics to generate similar content to the highest performing posts becomes a practice, and getting an influencer's like becomes a reinforcement of their goals.

The air felt cool and humid as they breathed it in. Clouds were forming in the horizon and the wind started to pick up.</p> <p>\u201cMost people can\u2019t tell when one is coming anymore.\u201d He continued. </p> <p>\u201cI know. They\u2019ve forgotten how to listen to nature.\u201d Replied his granddaughter, _____, in awe at the spectacle in front of them.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean this storm.\" He said, taking a stronger grip on the balcony's rail. \u201cOur time here is limited. As I near the end...\u201d </p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d She interrupted him, noticing the many wrinkles on his face, a reflection of every experience and emotion he had carried across his lifetime. He had refused to go under the knife to correct them. She had grown to appreciate them as proof of what he had lived. </p> <p>\"When you look back on your life, you realize the only thing that mattered was love and those moments built around it.\" He turned to look at his granddaughter\u2019s eyes, seeing a gleam of hope for the future, wrapped in concern for her safety.</p> <p>\"History keeps repeating. Life is much worse in periods of silence like these, where human thought is suppressed through fear. We are privileged, because they still need us, but most of our people have been forced to forget.\" </p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to worry me.\u201d She said, noticing the seriousness in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cWorry is a sign to get ready. A lot will change. Your principles will be tested. You will have to make decisions that will affect people\u2019s lives and they can be heavy to carry. You can only do the best you can with the knowledge you have. Avoid making assumptions.</p> <p>\"Be careful who you trust. Do not get taken by empty words. I don't think you can trust _____.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I know him well, he\u2019s practically family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn this environment, his actions lived in a bubble. He is not the same person out there. I worry that he is not who we think he is. I hope to be proved wrong, but you can grow up in the same household and be opposite people. I fear, in my hope to protect him, I encouraged him to take more than to give. He is privileged above the rest.\" As he said that, the weight of the past felt so heavy in his heart that it could have pulled it down many floors.</p> <p>\u201cListen, _____. I have been prepping something for you. It will be delivered in an unexpected way. You\u2019ll know what I mean when the time comes. This is important. No one can know about it.\u201d She nodded, knowing how complex a human being her grandfather was, so much so, that the idea of something unexpected was to be expected.</p> <p>\u201cHe cannot know about it either. He thinks he knows you just as you think you know him. They might use him to try to get to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you not trust him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople who seek attention are often malleable, their principles don\u2019t exist in the ways we both understand them. Easy money removes the value of our effort and time. It can drive people to seek easy paths and the fastest way up to whatever ladder they think exists. Popularity may be popular in this society, but it doesn\u2019t make you who you are. That depends on your actions and the reasons behind them. Your choices must be independent of whether people love you, hate you or cancel you. They\u2019re your inner protocol.\u201d</p> <p>He continued speaking, as if he wanted to pour a lifetime of knowledge into those few minutes. He hoped to have given her enough tools to manage what was coming, but what he wished for the most was to have prevented it altogether.</p> <p>\u201cWhen words are built for headlines, stats, or votes, they cannot be trusted. You cannot trust someone who masks the truth, often not taking the time to dig deeper, to try to see the 360\u00b0 view. Nothing is as simple as it seems. A lot of what you see and hear are just fa\u00e7ades inside games of power and control. You must learn to see what's behind them.\u201d   </p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to have people you trust wholeheartedly. You discover them when you spot similar principles and patterns of action. When you are lucky enough to have such a person, you keep them close, as they\u2019ll have your back. You protect them as they protect you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas grandma that for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I was too blind to see it in time. Do not make the same mistake.\u201d</p> <p>He removed a locket from his neck, one he had carried for as long as she had been under his care, and gave it to her. </p> <p>As she took it in the palm of her hand, tears started swelling in her eyes, like the clouds rolling in. </p> <p>The skies darkened and small rain droplets started falling, making a melancholic sound against the metal structure\u2026</p>"},{"location":"read/index.html#the-setting","title":"The setting","text":"<p>In the city yet unnamed, the four massive vermilion gates, which once stood for truth, courage, and freedom, had become an association to fear.

Instead of being open and filled with activity, they had been restructured to almost become walls.

Freedom is a natural state of humanity, it cannot be erased from our subconscious though fear may try. Deep within, away from that which corrodes the spirit, we all carry the essence of freedom. We all crave truth. While those feelings seemed to lay dormant, no one could predict the exact place where that spark of change could come from, but it always does. No stronger spark exists than in those places where hope seems lost, for it is then that it is most valued.
