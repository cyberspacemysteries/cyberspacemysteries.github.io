**No journey is ever walked alone. If you care about improving some of the design challenges nostr faces, then, you already belong.**

# Welcome. This is the Nostr-ings Club

## Keep Nostr Weird 

Nostr is active innovation. It is a journey to reimagine the familiar and to bring new ideas into reality. Nostr is breaking away from the strings of platforms. Design challenges abound. We explore the design possibilities of the nostrverse, and create both an open [practical handbook]({{ '/handbook/' | relative_url }}) and design tools.

Each week, a new challenge will become the focus for nostr community design efforts.

## Special Thanks

We stand on the shoulders of giants... Thank you to all of those who have contributed to making FOSS what it is today. Nostr-ings has been built on the foundation of the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design). This website uses its core code and it hopes to carry its ideals of openness, community, and design principles unto nostr.
