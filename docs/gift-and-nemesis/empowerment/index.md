## self-custody

Bitcoin gives you the choice to own it 100%, if you learn to keep it safely in your own self-custodial wallet and with your own keys. You may have no need for a bank or an outside party to keep your bitcoin, though you may need a third party if you want to exchange it for your local currency. These third parties are often exchanges, and as a best practice, you should NOT keep your bitcoin in an exchange, instead choosing your own self-custody wallet.

To HODL bitcoin is a personal responsibility you can choose, instead of delegating it to a third party. It is a form of autonomy. The more we learn about bitcoin, the more we value autonomy. This makes a difference in how we live our lives, the responsibility and challenges that we take, and even where we choose to live.

When something infringes on that autonomy, it makes us rethink our choices and look for possible solutions.
