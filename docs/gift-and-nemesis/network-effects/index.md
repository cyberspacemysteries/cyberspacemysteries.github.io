# I-Got-Your-Back Protocol
<!-- excerpt ends before this -->

# one client's win is a win for all of nostr.

Nostr is interoperable. If you've heard the word protocol tossed around, without knowing its meaning: Imagine if Facebook and Twitter were both written with the same foundational code, so you could enter both of them and access your same profile, follows, followers, and posts on both of them, no matter which one you chose to use. People could find you on Facebook, even if you were only using Twitter. The difference between them would be the design and unique features they could offer you. Unfortunately, they are platforms choosing to run their own code, instead of running on an interoperable protocol.

Nostr is different. It has a community of developers working on different projects. These projects all run nostr as their foundation. They could be thought of as competing with each other, because they can add similar features, and yet, each one also offers something unique. Every milestone each one reaches, makes the whole community stronger, pushing development and innovation into new horizons. It also gives you choice and access, unlike anything you've seen before. It's a win win.

We celebrate the small steps forward creating new avenues of access to nostr. One client's win, is a win for all of nostr.

Interoperability means thinking beyond yourself, beyond individual products, into the possibilities to support the whole. #Nostr is an I-got-your-back protocol.

## Santa's PoW & network effects

Nostr is like Santa's workshop all-year-round. Features are the gifts of products that have a direct effect on our daily lives. They can empower and protect the individual. Their foundational principles are the magic.

Nostriches around the world send their letters to nostr Santas in the shape of notes, asking developers for what they wish the most.

Open source is open, because anyone can add their grain of sand and contribute to a project they care about. It is work we can verify, looking through the GitHubs, and sometime in the future, the nostr GitNests of those projects we love.

The nostr protocol is a strong foundation to BUIDL upon, but its use and spread depends on its network effects. The stronger the community bonds, the stronger the protocol. It is a give and take.
