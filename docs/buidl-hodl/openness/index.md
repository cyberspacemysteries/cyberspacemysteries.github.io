## rain

“No matter how well you water plants, they can never quite grow like when it rains,” grandpa used to say, as he watered the garden late in the afternoon, awaiting the rainy season.

When we work on our own, outside of open-source teamwork, outside of open resources for anyone in the world, it can often feel like waiting for rain.

FOSS has a way of gathering a unique mixture of creativity, coupled with caring about humanity, strengthened by a breath of freedom. It is as if it could rain on anyone and that rain could help buidl stronger solutions.
