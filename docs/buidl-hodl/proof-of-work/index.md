# Do you know your developer?

One of the strongest protections of someone's work is PoW and the network effects it generates as it spreads across communities. As long as we stay connected to the builders, no one should be able to come, clone a project, and take all the credit for other people's work.

At the heart of every project is not its code, but its people. Grateful for all those contributing to FOSS.
