# Nostr in time
## A before and after

**Looking at nostr client progress.** 

<!-- excerpt ends before this -->

On our day to day use of nostr, it is easy to lose track of the many improvements and unique experiences it offers. If we look back in time, we can see how much some nostrverse projects have grown. This is a field trip to document those changes across time.

### field trip focus

- differentiating features
- interoperability
- zaps & value4value
- tools for content creators  



## Coracle
developer: [hodlbod@coracle.social](https://nostr.com/npub1jlrs53pkdfjnts29kveljul2sm0actt6n8dxrrzqcersttvcuv3qdjynqn)

*differentiating feature:* **music**


One of the best features in nostr is showing content based on who you follow and on who your follows follow (a.k.a. your network). It helps you see content based on your interests, and it helps fight spam. 

Coracle has taken a unique approach to this. It now has a note button that finds music on nostr from your network. You can listen while you look through your notes.
