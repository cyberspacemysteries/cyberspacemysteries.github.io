## Revealing the hidden strings

The internet opened cyberspace to learning, creativity, self expression, and borderless global connections to other people. The way of closed platforms, like Twitter & Facebook, created invisible strings on our identities. Platforms give us impossible choices. We do not own our social media accounts, using them means giving away our data, yet we cannot connect with the people we know unless we join their services.

Nostr is rewriting cyberspace rules, giving you back control and choice. Nostr-ings reveals the hidden strings, so you can choose the way technology is part of your life.

## Supporting decentralized development through client discovery

One of nostr's strengths is having a growing variety of apps, microapps, and websites built on nostr. Nostr's network effects can be strengthened if these clients are discoverable so people may choose to try them, instead of only being aware of a small subset of nostr clients who have become better known.
