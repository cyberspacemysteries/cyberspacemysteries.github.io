## A supportive design & discovery testing ground to help the nostr community craft evolving [nostr](https://nostr.com) experiences

Nostr is not just about your notes spread out on relays (servers), uncontrolled by a company. You can use the same login keys to enter most nostr clients. No need for a new account. Your nostr keys carry your identity, your friends, and your history.

Nostr is not just one website or one app, it is the underlying code to a [nostrverse]({{ '/guide/getting-started/introduction/' | relative_url }}) of products and tools. You can have a favorite app or website, or try different ones for their unique features.

**One set of keys to the [nostrverse]({{ '/guide/getting-started/introduction/' | relative_url }})**





**Nostr-ings is a work-in-progress**
