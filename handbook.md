# A Nostr-ings Handbook

The nostr protocol is a series of code puzzle pieces that can be put together to shape unique products. Combined with UI/UX design, nostr builders can craft unique product experiences to empower people through choice and control over their identities, networks, and their unique journey of self-expression.  

**This is a drawing board, testing ground, and practical handbook to design & redesign the nostr experience.**
