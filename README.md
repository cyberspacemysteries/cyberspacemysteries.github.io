# FREEDOM WEAVER

## The making of a sci-fi freedom tech story

Exploring our cyberspace for those technological gifts and their nemesis. These discoveries will shape the base layers for a post apocalyptic science fiction story showing where those two paths could leadâ€¦

Through an open behind the scenes process, I'll be sharing thoughts and tips, asking questions, and creating open UX #design resources as I test and learn more about the why behind the tech.

The primary tech focus will be on #bitcon, #nostr, and their symbiosis. I'll be taking the writing aspect of storytelling and making it come alive through #art, 3D modeling, #music, and animation.

Come along this creative journey as the story gets weaved, along with smaller, educational, yet kind of fun pieces.

Find me on nostr only
